Also, I did my best to avoid all the goofy aah metaphors and flowery language you see in essays posted to the internet because I felt that the clarity of my narrative was more important than how \""quirky\"" it sounded.

I struggled a lot with balancing college coursework, my social life, and my ecs with my transfer applications.

But I knew I'd regret it for my whole life if I didn't submit any applications, so I pushed through my self-doubt. I worked on my essays alone in my dorm during ungodly hours of the night. I remember finishing my microeconomics problem set at 4am, only to stay awake until 7am working on my UPenn supplements 💀 To any future transfers, pls don't let forums like this or r/TransferToTop25 pressure you to give up!

I'm from one of those insane competitive towns with a lot of Asian immigrants, and I always had worse stats and extracurriculars than my friends, even in elementary school. My parents gave me more freedom compared to other Asian immigrants in my town lol. While my friends performed at Carnegie Hall or competed at regional science fairs, I did normal kid stuff. This meant that I had lots of time to explore what I was truly passionate about. I taught myself to write stories, make digital art, and fell in love with political history. Even though I knew I was ambitious and had huge dreams, I didn't believe I was smart enough to ever get into an Ivy. During my senior year, I applied to my current school through ED2 and withdrew all of my Ivy applications. I love my current school a lot, but part of me regretted the decision. What if I actually could get in? So during my freshman year of college, I threw my hat in the ring, and it worked."", ""Although I ended up changing my career aspirations, the interests I cultivated on my own were a huge help to my application and have helped me gain access to a lot of cool opportunities while in college. I used to think my parents raised me wrong because I wasn't as talented as the people I grew up with. I now realize I was wrong. Because in the end, the ambition and determination I gained from my upbringing, not just my raw intelligence, helped me get accepted. If you lock in like crazy on your goals, you're gonna achieve amazing things no matter where you end up!""]"

"Main Essay (8.5/10): Was pretty good, and had a college counselor (matchlighters program) help me (who I love). She kept saying that it was great and the best of her students, but I just thought it was good, nothing crazy. Mainly talked about how I took caring for my family and used it to fuel my passion for politics + law as a force for good after coming from generational oppression at the hands of politics. Took the most time, wasn't rushed",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Supplementals: Didn't have her review as much of my supplemental. The MIT supplemental was only 100-words, I at most spent 20mins on it. They were all over the place (depending on if she reviewed them)",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Additional info**: My parents hired a college consulting firm for me, but I won't talk about too much about it in this post so PM me if you're curious about that. Another piece of advice to future college applicants is to **be wary of what u see on this subreddit (and definitely don't do ecs just bc you feel pressured to like I did)**. Also, just don't stress too much bc I think this sub gives students way too much stress. College is not the end-all-be-all. Apply to schools you want to go to, not schools others want you to go to. And **definitely apply to safeties** (unlike what I did)!!",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
